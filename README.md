# bmi-calculator-react
This application was built using React, and allows users to calculate their body mass index (BMI) based on their weight and height.
When you open the app, you'll see a simple and intuitive interface that prompts you to enter your weight and height. Once you enter the values and click the "Calculate" button, the app will display your BMI and a corresponding message that indicates whether your BMI is in the underweight, normal, overweight, or obese range.
Overall, this app represents my first steps in React development and showcases my skills in React, state management, and user interface design.
